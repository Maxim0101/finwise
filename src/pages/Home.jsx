            At FinWise, our mission is to make financial literacy accessible, engaging, and empowering for people of all backgrounds. 
            Weâ€™re here to help users take control of their financial futures, one skill and one supportive connection at a time.

          <h3 className={styles.storyTitle}>Why FinWise?</h3>
          <p className={styles.story}>
            Having no knowledge about loans and interest capitalization, my immigrant mother quickly drowned in college debt â€” 
            a fate all too common in the U.S. To combat this, I founded the Triple Threat Club during high school to help students fight the 
            three barriers to financial independence: financial illiteracy, student debt, and underemployment.
          </p>

          <p className={styles.story}>
            I originally began developing an iOS app called MoneyWise, but I soon scrapped that idea in favor of something more accessible to everyone â€” 
            regardless of device or platform. That vision became FinWise: a web app dedicated to education, support, and empowerment.
