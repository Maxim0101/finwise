# Northeastern Hackathon Project

In this project, I developed a simple front end website called finwise in 24 hours. Finwise is meant to help people become financially literate and independent by giving them basic and advanced knowledge. I practiced HTML, CSS, React, and Vite. I also created a simple database using Firebase to store accounts.
